This is an extra example and tutorial about [FrEIA](https://github.com/VLL-HD/FrEIA) with rich description. If you are interested in **Invertible Neural Network** or **Flow-Model**,  hope this repo can help you to understand the framework and modules as well.

Feel free to contact me if you encounter any problems in the code.

## Graph-INN (refer to sequential.py)
